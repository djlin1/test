README for FIDA calibration information.
As of this date
20130130
this is teh directory for the FIDA calibration data
for the "2G" FIDA system, that is the "oblique" system
installed by Chris Muscatello.

The first set of wavelength calibration numbers are for 
date 10/19/2009, which is the last startup day for this
run campaign.
139469 on 10/19/2009.
The calibration data indicates that there are valid numbers
for date 10/19/2009.
Thus the numbers are assumed to be valid for shots during
this run campaign has shot numbers
139469 (10/19/2009) - 142928 (4/30/2010)
from the last day of startup to the post-run beam-into-gas.
However, the next set of claibrations begin on
2/2/2010.  The closest shot number is 141811 on 2/26/2010.

Muscatello's apply_intens_calib.pro indicates that for shot
numbers less than 143161 that the calibration directory is
'back2010b', with sub-directories PATCH1-PATCH4 with a 
calibration file for each channel.

The second set of calibration numbers begin on 2/2/2010.
This would be shots 141811 and beyond.  However there is not
another intensity calibration for this shot range, so we
will use the calibration from 'back2010b'

The next set of calibration numbers are from 4/21/2011.
This would be after the LTO-II which begins with plasma shots
146907 on 10/17/2011.

The next set of calibration numbers are from 2/14/2012.
The closest relevant plasma shot is 148650.

Patch panel information.
For years 2009-2010 there were a number of patch panels settings.
Eatch patch panel setting has a corresponding intensity
calibration and major radius of measurement.
For example, intensity calib from back2010b has four directories
PATCH1, 2, 3, 4
each with a calibration for channels 1-6.

The patch panel settings can be obtained from summary search for
FIDA and scroll down to the diagnostics log.
For example you will see
************ 1G FIDA **********
-f01-  -f02-
Chord  Chord
V1     V2
************ 2G FIDA **********
-f03-          -f04-
Channel Chord  Channel Chord
2       P6     1       P1
4       P9     3       R2
6       P5     5       P4

where each channel maps to a fiber (chord) at a given radius.
Lets use Xi Chen's documnetation for 143701-148701
PATCH 9
Radii are 191, 203, 214, 223, 170, 181.
This does not correlate with anything I have so I need help.

P1 here means fibers 1,2,3 that are arranged vertically all
go to channel 1 and collect light from essentially one
major radius.

Therefore there are 33 total fibers giving 11 possible radii
for the measurement.

For example:

05152012	148702 	1G (f01-v01) (f02-v02)
			2G PATCH 9.
